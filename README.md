# processing-music-visualizer
Collection of processing scripts to visualize music

Warning, the current version is a bit "seizure-y". Please exercise
caution before viewing. I'm working to make it more pleasant.

Requires [Processing](https://processing.org/) software to run.

Re-mixes welcome. Please share.

## On Windows 7 and above

This code captures music playback using the default recording
device. This means that you need to make the default recording device
one that captures the currently playing music. On Windows 7 and above
this can be done by setting the default recording device to "Stereo
Mix". In order to see "Stereo Mix" you may need to toggle "Show
Disabled Devices".

## Other OS's

Not sure, but it's likely that you will need to change a
setting for it to capture the music playback instead of say the
microphone.
